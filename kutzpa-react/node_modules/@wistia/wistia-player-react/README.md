# Wistia Player React Wrapper

Wistia's React Wrapper of the `<wistia-player/>` web component. Used to add responsive, lightweight, and SEO-friendly videos to your site.

For more usage information, check out our [Wistia Player React Component documentation](https://docs.wistia.com/docs/player-react-component).

## Getting started

```bash
npm install @wistia/wistia-player-react
```

### Simple player

The only required prop is `mediaId`, the ID of the media that will be embedded.

```jsx
import { WistiaPlayer } from '@wistia/wistia-player-react';

<WistiaPlayer mediaId="abc123" />;
```

### Player with embed options and event callback

The `<WistiaPlayer>` component takes the same options (as React props) which one can set on the `<wistia-player>` web component. There is a list at the [Embed options](https://wistia.com/support/developers/embed-options) support page. The only difference here is that numbers, booleans, etc are expected to be JS values of those types rather than strings. Event callbacks can also be added, formatted in a way which is familiar React development (e.g. the `play` event would become `onPlay`).

```jsx
import { WistiaPlayer } from '@wistia/wistia-player-react';

<WistiaPlayer
  mediaId="abc123"
  playerColor="1e64f0"
  onPlay={() => console.log('Wistia video is playing!')}
/>;
```

### Additional Options

#### Avoiding layout shifts

The player will automatically load in a lightweight placeholder "swatch" image as soon as possible. However, in certain cases (such as server-side rendering) there can still be a slight layout shift while we wait for that placeholder. In order to avoid shift completely, you can explicitly set the `aspect` of your video:

```jsx
import { WistiaPlayer } from '@wistia/wistia-player-react';

<WistiaPlayer mediaId="abc123" aspect={16 / 9} />;
```

#### Fixed-size Embeds

The player is responsive by default. If a fixed-size player is better for your use-case, you can pass in `width` and `height` values instead:

```jsx
import { WistiaPlayer } from '@wistia/wistia-player-react';

<WistiaPlayer
  mediaId="abc123"
  style={{
    width: '640px',
    height: '360px',
  }}
/>;
```

#### Popovers

Wistia’s “popovers” are video embeds that open in modal overlays when a target element is clicked. For these embeds, there is an explicit, _required_ `wistiaPopover` prop (`true`/`false`) as well as an optional `popoverContent` prop. If left undefined, the default `popoverContent` value is `thumbnail`. For popovers with `popoverContent="link`, the `<WistiaPlayer>` component expects to have children.

```jsx
import { WistiaPlayer } from '@wistia/wistia-player-react';

<WistiaPlayer mediaId="abc123" wistiaPopover={true} popoverContent="link">
  <span>Popover Link</span>
</WistiaPlayer>;
```
